## 🔧 Development & Integration

### ROS2 Integration
To integrate with ROS2 nodes:
```python
# Add to ble_server.py
import rclpy
from your_msgs.msg import YourMessageType

# In read_request_callback:
# - Query ROS2 topics for robot status
# - Return real sensor data

# In write_request_callback:
# - Parse received commands
# - Publish to ROS2 topics
# - Control robot behavior
```

### Custom Commands
Extend the server by modifying the callback functions:
```python
def write_request_callback(self, characteristic: BlessGATTCharacteristic, value, **kwargs):
    """Handle write requests with bless 0.2.6 API"""
    try:
        # Update characteristic value
        characteristic.value = value
        
        # Decode command
        command = value.decode('utf-8')
        if command == "move_forward":
            # Implement robot movement
            pass
        elif command == "get_sensors":
            # Return sensor data via read_request_callback
            pass
        elif command.startswith("SPEED:"):
            speed = int(command.split(":")[1])
            # Set robot speed
            pass
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Command processing error: {e}")
```

### Adding New Characteristics
To add more BLE characteristics (bless 0.2.6 API):
```python
from bless import GATTCharacteristicProperties, GATTAttributePermissions

# In setup_server method:
NEW_CHAR_UUID = "aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee"

# Define properties and permissions
char_properties = (
    GATTCharacteristicProperties.read 
    | GATTCharacteristicProperties.write
)
char_permissions = (
    GATTAttributePermissions.readable 
    | GATTAttributePermissions.writeable
)

# Add to existing service
await self.server.add_new_characteristic(
    SERVICE_UUID,        # service_uuid
    NEW_CHAR_UUID,       # char_uuid
    char_properties,     # properties
    None,               # initial_value
    char_permissions    # permissions
)

# Handle in read/write callbacks based on characteristic.uuid
```

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
**Issue**: Server fails to start with permission errors
```bash
# Solution 1: Check Bluetooth permissions
# macOS: System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Bluetooth
# Linux: Run with sudo or add user to bluetooth group

# Solution 2: Verify dependencies
pip install -r bluetooth_requirements.txt

# Solution 3: Check Bluetooth hardware
# Ensure Bluetooth is enabled and working
```

### Device Not Discoverable
**Issue**: Mobile apps can't find "YahboomRobot"
```bash
# Check server logs for advertising confirmation
# Look for: "📡 Advertising as: YahboomRobot"

# Verify service UUID matches expectations
# Ensure no firewall is blocking Bluetooth

# Try restarting Bluetooth service
# macOS: Turn Bluetooth off/on in System Preferences
# Linux: sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
```

### Connection Issues
**Issue**: Can connect but can't read/write data
```bash
# Check characteristic UUIDs match exactly
# Verify read/write permissions on characteristics
# Review server logs for callback execution
# Ensure mobile app has proper BLE permissions
```

### API Errors & Version Issues
**Issue**: `bless` library API errors (characteristic creation fails)
```bash
# CRITICAL: Use bless 0.2.6 (NOT 0.2.4)
pip install bless==0.2.6 bleak==0.19.5 async-timeout==4.0.3

# Common error with 0.2.4:
# "BleakGATTCharacteristicBlueZDBus.__init__() missing 1 required positional argument"

# Solution: Upgrade to 0.2.6
pip install --upgrade bless==0.2.6

# Check Python version (3.7+ required for asyncio)
python3 --version

# Verify no conflicting Bluetooth libraries
pip list | grep -i blue
```

**Issue**: Ubuntu/Linux D-Bus errors
```bash
# Ensure dbus_next is installed (critical for BlueZ communication)
pip install dbus_next>=1.2.0

# Error: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dbus_next'"
# Solution: Always install from requirements.txt on Linux systems
```

### BlueZ Version Compatibility
**Issue**: Write operations time out on Jetson Nano/older BlueZ versions
```bash
# Error: "CBATTErrorDomain Code=14 'Unlikely error.'"
# Cause: BlueZ 5.53 (Jetson Nano) vs BlueZ 5.64+ (Ubuntu 22.04)

# Solution: Use --jetson compatibility flag
# On Jetson Nano server:
python3 ble_server.py --jetson

# On client connecting to Jetson server:
python3 ble_client_test.py --jetson

# Technical details:
# - BlueZ 5.53: Requires write_without_response for callbacks
# - BlueZ 5.64+: Supports write_with_response automatically
# - --jetson flag enables dual-mode characteristic properties
```
