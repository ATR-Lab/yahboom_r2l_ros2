### Mobile Apps for Testing
| Platform | Recommended App | Developer |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| Android | nRF Connect for Mobile | Nordic Semiconductor |
| iOS | LightBlue Explorer | Punch Through |
| Cross-platform | BLE Scanner | Various developers |

### Testing Steps
1. **Start Server**: `python3 ble_server.py`
2. **Open BLE Scanner**: Launch your chosen mobile app
3. **Scan for Devices**: Look for "YahboomRobot"
4. **Connect**: Tap to connect to the device
5. **Explore Service**: Navigate to service UUID `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc`
6. **Read Status**: Read from characteristic `11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555`
7. **Send Commands**: Write data to test bidirectional communication

### Expected Behavior
- ‚úÖ Device appears in scan results as "YahboomRobot"
- ‚úÖ Connection establishes successfully
- ‚úÖ Custom service is discoverable
- ‚úÖ Read operations return JSON status data
- ‚úÖ Write operations are logged in server console
- ‚úÖ Server handles multiple connections gracefully

## üîß Development & Integration

### ROS2 Integration
To integrate with ROS2 nodes:
```python
# Add to ble_server.py
import rclpy
from your_msgs.msg import YourMessageType

# In read_request_callback:
# - Query ROS2 topics for robot status
# - Return real sensor data

# In write_request_callback:
# - Parse received commands
# - Publish to ROS2 topics
# - Control robot behavior
```

### Custom Commands
Extend the server by modifying the callback functions:
```python
def write_request_callback(self, characteristic, value, offset, without_response):
    try:
        command = value.decode('utf-8')
        if command == "move_forward":
            # Implement robot movement
            pass
        elif command == "get_sensors":
            # Return sensor data
            pass
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Command processing error: {e}")
```

### Adding New Characteristics
To add more BLE characteristics:
```python
# In setup_server method:
NEW_CHAR_UUID = "aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee"
await self.server.add_new_service(NEW_CHAR_UUID)

# Handle in read/write callbacks
```

## üõ† Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
**Issue**: Server fails to start with permission errors
```bash
# Solution 1: Check Bluetooth permissions
# macOS: System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Bluetooth
# Linux: Run with sudo or add user to bluetooth group

# Solution 2: Verify dependencies
pip install -r bluetooth_requirements.txt

# Solution 3: Check Bluetooth hardware
# Ensure Bluetooth is enabled and working
```

### Device Not Discoverable
**Issue**: Mobile apps can't find "YahboomRobot"
```bash
# Check server logs for advertising confirmation
# Look for: "üì° Advertising as: YahboomRobot"

# Verify service UUID matches expectations
# Ensure no firewall is blocking Bluetooth

# Try restarting Bluetooth service
# macOS: Turn Bluetooth off/on in System Preferences
# Linux: sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
```

### Connection Issues
**Issue**: Can connect but can't read/write data
```bash
# Check characteristic UUIDs match exactly
# Verify read/write permissions on characteristics
# Review server logs for callback execution
# Ensure mobile app has proper BLE permissions
```

### API Errors
**Issue**: `bless` library API errors
```bash
# Ensure exact versions from requirements.txt
pip install bless==0.2.4 bleak==0.19.5 async-timeout==4.0.3

# Check Python version (3.7+ required for asyncio)
python3 --version

# Verify no conflicting Bluetooth libraries
pip list | grep -i blue
```
